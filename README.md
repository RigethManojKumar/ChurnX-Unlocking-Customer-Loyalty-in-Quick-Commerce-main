# **ChurnX: Unlocking Customer Loyalty in Quick Commerce 🚀**

Welcome to **ChurnX**, where we predict customer churn before it happens—because in the lightning-fast world of quick commerce, losing customers faster than your delivery time isn’t just unfortunate, it’s a disaster.

---

## 🧠 **Abstract**

In the high-stakes arena of quick commerce (think Blinkit, Zepto, Swiggy Instamart), customer churn is a silent killer. ChurnX leverages a **Random Forest Classifier**, interactive **Power BI dashboards**, and **SQLite** to predict which users are likely to leave. With features like *Days Since Last Order* and *Delivery Issues*, we help businesses retain valuable customers before they vanish.

---

## 🎯 **Objectives**

* Predict customer churn with reliable accuracy.
* Identify top churn indicators like delivery issues and inactivity.
* Visualize churn trends using interactive dashboards.
* Help platforms reduce churn, increase loyalty, and stay competitive.

---

## 🔥 **Key Features**

* Random Forest model with **66.5% accuracy** (based on a simulated dataset—real data would likely improve this).
* Clean **data preprocessing and feature engineering**.
* Interactive **Power BI dashboard** with actionable insights.
* Lightweight **SQLite** database for efficient data handling.

---

## 🛠 **Tech Stack**

* **Python** (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
* **SQLite** (simple and practical data storage)
* **Power BI** (beautiful, informative visualizations)

---

## 📊 **Results**

* **Model Accuracy**: 66.5%
* **Top Churn Predictors**: Order recency, delivery issues, discount usage

> Because nothing says “I’m leaving” like a late order or an expired coupon.

---

## 🚀 **Future Scope**

* Explore advanced models like **XGBoost** for better performance.
* Implement **real-time churn prediction**.
* Enrich dataset with additional features to improve model accuracy and business insights.

## ⚡ **Deliverables**

* 📄 Project Report
* 📊 Power BI Dashboard
* 🤖 Trained Random Forest Model (`.pkl`)

## ✨ Final Note

No patent, no paper (yet)—but the project works, and it's open for anyone to build on. In a fast-moving world, execution beats perfection.

Thanks for checking out **ChurnX**—where we catch customers before they churn.
Because no one likes being left behind.
